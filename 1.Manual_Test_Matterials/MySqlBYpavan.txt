3) import downloaded database to MySQL workbench:
=> Workbench > Server > data import > import from select self content file > select file > open.
> select database in workbench > start import > refresh..

4. start working : 
=> use classicmodels(DB name)..(to connect the database I want to work on)
=> describe information_schema  (to get the info about reference table)
=> select tables; (to get the table names)
=> select count(*) as numberOfColumns from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'customer';
=> select column_name from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'customer';
=> select column_name, data_type from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'customer';
=> select column_name, column_type from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'customer';(to get the date_type with size by column_type)
=> select column_name, column_key from information_schema.columns where table_name = 'customer';(to get the key_type)
